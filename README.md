# Katling

This is a wrapper of the [Gatling](http://gatling.io) API for Java and Kotlin.

## Introduction

This lib offers very little functionality on top of Gatling, 
since the goal is to offer the tools to make it usable from Java/Kotlin. 
The hope is to provide the basic abstractions other libraries can extend upon to build better test solutions.
